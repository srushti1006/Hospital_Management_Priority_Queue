# Hospital_Management_Priority_Queue

<h2>Problem</h2>
In Hospital it is very important to treat people according to priority. 
For example people with accidents should be treated urgently so they are added in serious illness. 

<h2>Solution</h2>
This project is developed in C language. It is implemented using Priority Queue Data Structure
It is a menu Driven program where user gets to select options like adding patients data, treating patient, display the current patient, display all the patients.
There are 3 queues used for priority.
Similarly there are 3 categories. They are Serious, Medium and General.
Once a patient is added they are queued and once they are treated they are Dequeued.

<h2>Folder structure</h2>
header.h contains Declarations of all the functions used.
main.cpp is used to take input from user and give output
Other functions are separately written i other cpp files.

**File names are .cpp but the code is in C language
