# Hospital_Management_Priority_Queue

Problem
In Hospital it is very important to treat people according to priority. 
For example people with accidents should be treated urgently so they are added in serious illness. 

Solution
This project is developed in C language. It is implemented using Priority Queue Data Structure
It is a menu Driven program where user gets to select options like adding patients data, treating patient, display the current patient, display all the patients.
There are 3 queues used for priority.
Similarly there are 3 categories. They are Serious, Medium and General.
Once a patient is added they are queued and once they are treated they are Dequeued.

Folder structure
header.h contains Declarations of all the functions used.
main.cpp is used to take input from user and give output
Other functions are separately written i other cpp files.

**File names are .cpp but the code is in C language
